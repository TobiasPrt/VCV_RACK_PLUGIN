## Modules

### Capacitor2

<p>

This module is a straight-up port of Chris Johnsons Capacitor2 plugin. The addition is only a panel designed to be potentially buildable in hardware and some smaller tweaks.

> "[Capacitor2] emphasizes transients and brings out the articulateness of sounds in a really distinctive way. You may not have heard anything quite like this… or if you’ve been using analog gear, maybe you’re used to hearing it. I really didn’t plan for the result I got: if real-world caps have any of this behavior, it explains a lot. Literally all that’s happening is modulating the cutoff frequency of the rather Airwindows-y Capacitor algorithm. There’s no dynamics processing in there at all, but the result is incredibly dynamic. (you can even use it to boost narrow bandpasses for effect!)"

This module is a straight-up port of Chris Johnsons rawGlitters plugin. The addition is only a panel designed to be potentially buildable in hardware and some smaller tweaks.

> "RawGlitters is the early non-dither I made that does the opposite of Dither Me Timbers: rather than do a precursor of Dark and find the mellowest, smoothest truncation option, RawGlitters (StudioTan) always tries to find the direction to truncate that is going to accentuate the highs the most. It still only truncates, and works like a dither would. You can leave DeRez off, and at either 24 or 16 bit you’ll find it gives a distinct tone to your 24 or 16 bit output. It really lights up the detail of the track, always in a subtle way right down at the noise floor."
